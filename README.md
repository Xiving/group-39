# Machine Learning project group 39
A Python Machine Learning project where we try to classify tree types using a training- and data-set that includes data regarding the environment of said to be classified tree.

## Usage

Execute the python program using:

```
$ python *file-name*

First you want to have the repo locally stored, so either clone it using:

Then create a new branch with a name that indicates the intention/owner of the branch.

After altering the code make sure to commit your changes and push those.
